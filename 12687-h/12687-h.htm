    <i>Enter</i>

    Tranto,

    <p>TRANTO. Good evening.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>turning slightly in her seat and giving him her left hand,
    the right still holding a pen</i>

    ). Good evening. Excuse me one moment.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. All right about my dining here to-night? (Hildegarde

    <i>nods</i>

    .) Larder equal to the strain?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Macaroni.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Splendid.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Beefsteak.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Great heavens! (
    <i>imitates sketchily the motions of cutting up a piece of
    steak. Shaking hands with</i>

    John,
    <i>who has risen</i>

    ). Well, John. How are things? Don't let me disturb you. Have a
    cigarette.</p>

    JOHN (
    <i>flattered</i>

    ). Thanks. (
    <i>As they light cigarettes</i>

    .) You're the first person here that's treated me like a human
    being.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Oh!</p>

    <p>JOHN. Yes. They all treat me as if I was a schoolboy home
    for the hols.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. But you are, aren't you?</p>

    <p>JOHN. In a way, of course. But&#8212;well, don't you see
    what I mean?</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>sympathetically</i>

    ). You mean that a schoolboy home for the hols isn't
    necessarily something escaped out of the Zoo.</p>

    <p>JOHN (
    <i>warming</i>

    ). That's it.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. In fact, what you mean is you're really an
    individual very like the rest of us, subject, if I may say so,
    to the common desires, weaknesses and prejudices of
    humanity&#8212;and not a damned freak.</p>

    <p>JOHN (
    <i>brightly</i>

    ). That's rather good, that is. If it's a question of the Zoo,
    what I say is&#8212;what price home? Now, homes
    <i>are</i>

    extraordinary if you like&#8212;I don't know whether you've
    ever noticed it. School&#8212;you can understand school. But
    home&#8212;! Strange things happen here while I'm away.</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 9 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page011" name="page011">[pg 11]</a>
    </span>

    TRANTO. Yes?</p>

    <p>JOHN. It was while I was away they appointed Dad a
    controller. When I heard&#8212;I laughed. Dad a controller!
    Why, he can't even control mother.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>without looking round</i>

    ). Oh yes he can.</p>

    <p>JOHN (
    <i>pretending to start back</i>

    ). Stay me with flagons! (
    <i>Resuming to</i>

    Tranto.) And
    <i>you're</i>

    something new here since the summer holidays.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I never looked at myself in that light. But I
    suppose I
    <i>am</i>

    rather new here.</p>

    <p>JOHN. Not quite new. But you've made a lot of progress
    during the last term.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. That's comforting.</p>

    <p>JOHN. You understand what I mean. You were rather stiff and
    prim in August&#8212;now you aren't a bit.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Just so. Well, I won't ask you what you think of
    <i>me</i>

    , John&#8212;you might tell me&#8212;but what do you think of
    my newspaper?</p>

    <p>JOHN.
    <i>The Echo</i>

    ? I don't know what to think. You see, we don't read newspapers
    much at school. Some of the masters do. And a few
<!-- Page 10 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page012" name="page012">[pg 12]</a>
    </span>

    chaps in the Fifth&#8212;swank, of course. But speaking
    generally we don't. Prefects don't. No time.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. How strange! Aren't you interested in the war?</p>

    <p>JOHN. Interested in the war! Would you mind if I spoke
    plainly?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I should love it.</p>

    <p>JOHN. Each time I come home I wonder more and more whether
    you people in London have got the slightest notion what war
    really is. Fact! At school, it's just because we
    <i>are</i>

    interested in the war that we've no time for newspapers.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. How's that?</p>

    <p>JOHN. How's that? Well, munition workshops&#8212;with
    government inspectors tumbling all over us about once a week.
    O.T.C. work. Field days. Cramming fellows for Sandhurst. Not to
    mention female masters. 'Mistresses,' I ought to say, perhaps.
    All these things take time.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I never thought of that.</p>

    <p>JOHN. No. People don't. However, I've decided to read
    newspapers in future&#8212;it'll be part of my scheme. That's
    why I was reading
<!-- Page 11 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page013" name="page013">[pg 13]</a>
    </span>

    <i>The Echo</i>

    . Now, I should like to ask you something about this paper of
    yours.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Yes.</p>

    <p>JOHN. Why do you let Hilda write those articles for you
    about food economy stunts in the household?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Well&#8212;(
    <i>hesitating</i>

    )</p>

    <p>JOHN. Now, I look at things practically. When Hilda'd spent
    all her dress allowance and got into debt besides, about a year
    and a half ago, she suddenly remembered she wasn't doing much
    to help the war, and so she went into the Food Ministry as a
    typist at thirty-five shillings a week. Next she learnt typing.
    Then she became an authority on everything. And now she's
    concocting these food articles for you. Believe me, the girl
    knows nothing whatever about cookery. She couldn't fry a
    sausage for nuts. Once the mater insisted on her doing the
    housekeeping&#8212;in the holidays, too! Stay me with
    flagons!</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>without looking round</i>

    ). Stay you with chocolates, you mean, Johnnie, dear.</p>

    <p>JOHN. There you are! Her thoughts fly instantly to
    chocolates&#8212;and in the fourth year of the greatest war
    that the world&#8212;</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Etcetera, etcetera.</p>

    <p>

    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page014" name="page014">[pg 14]</a>
    </span>

    TRANTO. Then do I gather that you don't entirely approve of
    your sister's articles?</p>

    <p>JOHN. Tripe, I think. My fag could write better. I'll tell
    you what I do approve of. I approve of that article to-day by
    that chap Sampson Straight about titles and the shameful
    traffic in honours, and the rot of the hereditary principle,
    and all that sort of thing.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I'm glad. Delivers the goods, doesn't he, Mr.
    Sampson Straight?</p>

    <p>JOHN. Well,
    <i>I</i>

    think so. Who is he?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. One of my discoveries, John. He sent me in an
    article about&#8212;let me see, when was it?&#8212;about eight
    months ago. I at once perceived that in Mr. Sampson Straight I
    had got on to a bit of all right. And I was not mistaken. He
    has given London beans pretty regularly once a week ever
    since.</p>

    <p>JOHN. He must have given the War Cabinet neuralgia this
    afternoon, anyhow. I should like to meet him.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I'm afraid that's impossible.</p>

    <p>JOHN. Is it? Why?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Well, I haven't met him myself yet. He lives at a
    quiet country place in Cornwall.

    Hermit, I believe. Hates any kind of publicity. Absolutely
    refuses to be photographed.</p>

    <p>JOHN. Photographed! I should think not! But couldn't you get
    him to come and lecture at school? We have frightful swells,
    you know.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I expect you do. But he wouldn't come.</p>

    <p>JOHN. I wish he would. We had a debate the other Saturday
    night on, Should the hereditary principle be abolished?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. And did you abolish it?</p>

    <p>JOHN. Did we abolish it? I should say we did. Eighty-five to
    twenty-one. Some debate, believe
    <i>me</i>

    !</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>looking round</i>

    ). Yes, but didn't you tell us once that in your Debating
    Society the speakers always tossed for sides beforehand?</p>

    <p>JOHN (
    <i>shrugging his shoulders. More confidentially to</i>

    Tranto). As I was saying, I'm going to read the papers in
    future, as part of my scheme. And d'you know what the scheme
    is? (
    <i>Impressively</i>

    .) I've decided to take up a political career.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Good!</p>

    <p>JOHN. Yes, it was during that hereditary principle debate
    that I decided. It came over me
<!-- Page 14 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page016" name="page016">[pg 16]</a>
    </span>

    all of a sudden while I was on the last lap of my speech and
    the fellows were cheering. And so I want to understand first of
    all the newspaper situation in London. There are one or two
    things about it I
    <i>don't</i>

    understand.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Not more? I can explain the newspaper situation to
    you in ten words. You know I've got a lot of uncles. I daresay
    I've got more uncles than anybody else in 'Who's Who.' Well, I
    own
    <i>The Echo</i>

    ,&#8212;inherited it from my father. My uncles own all the rest
    of the press&#8212;(
    <i>airily</i>

    ) with a few trifling exceptions. That's the London newspaper
    situation. Quite simple, isn't it?</p>

    <p>JOHN. But of course
    <i>The Echo</i>

    is up against all your uncles' papers&#8212;at least it seems
    so.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Absolutely up against them. Tooth and nail. Daggers
    drawn. No quarter. Death or victory.</p>

    <p>JOHN. But do you and your uncles speak to each other?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Best of friends.</p>

    <p>JOHN. But aren't two of your uncles lords?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Yes. Uncle Joe was made an earl not long
    since&#8212;you may have heard of the fuss about it. Uncle
    Sam's only a miserable baron yet. And Uncle Cuthbert is that
    paltry insect&#8212;a baronet.</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 15 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page017" name="page017">[pg 17]</a>
    </span>

    JOHN. What did they get their titles for?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Ask me another.</p>

    <p>JOHN. Of course I don't want to be personal, but
    <i>how</i>

    did they get them? Did they&#8212;er&#8212;buy them?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Don't know.</p>

    <p>JOHN. Haven't you ever asked them?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Well, John, you've got relatives yourself, and you
    probably know there are some things that even the most
    affectionate relatives
    <i>don't</i>

    ask each other.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>rising from the desk and looking at John's feet</i>

    ). Yes, indeed! This very morning I unwisely asked Johnnie
    whether his socks ever talked. Altercation followed. 'Some
    debate, believe
    <i>me</i>

    !'</p>

    <p>JOHN (
    <i>rising; with scornful tranquillity</i>

    ). I'd better get ready for dinner. Besides, you two would
    doubtless like to be alone together for a few precious
    moments.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>sharply and self-consciously</i>

    ). What do you mean?</p>

    <p>JOHN (
    <i>lightly</i>

    ). Nothing. I thought editor and contributor&#8212;</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Oh! I see.</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 16 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page018" name="page018">[pg 18]</a>
    </span>

    JOHN (
    <i>stopping at door, and turning round</i>

    ). Do you mean to say your uncles won't be frightfully angry at
    Mr. Sampson Straight's articles? Why, dash it, when he's
    talking about traffic in honours, if he doesn't mean them who
    does he mean?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. My dear friend, stuff like that's meat and drink to
    my uncles. They put it down like chocolates.</p>

    <p>JOHN. Well my deliberate opinion is&#8212;it's a jolly
    strange world. (
    <i>Exit quickly, back)</i>

    .</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>looking at</i>

    Hildegarde). So it is. Philosopher, John! Questions rather
    pointed perhaps; but result in the discovery of new truths. By
    the way, have I come too early?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>archly)</i>

    . How could you? But father's controlling the country half an
    hour more than usual this evening, and I expect mamma was so
    angry about it she forgot to telephone you that dinner's moved
    accordingly. (
    <i>With piquancy and humour</i>

    .) I was rather surprised to hear when I got home from my
    Ministry that you'd sent word you'd like to dine to-night.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Were you? Why?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Because last week when mamma
    <i>asked</i>

    you for to-night, you said you had another engagement.</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 17 -->

    </span>

    TRANTO. Oh! I'd forgotten I'd told her that. Still, I really
    had another engagement.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. The Countess of Blackfriars&#8212;you said.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Yes. Auntie Joe's. I've just sent her a telephone
    message to say I'm ill and confined to the house.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Which house?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I didn't specify any particular house.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. And are you ill?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I am not.... To get back to the realm of fact, when
    I read Sampson Straight's article about the degradation of
    honours this afternoon&#8212;</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Didn't you read it before you published it?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. No. I had to rush off and confront the Medical Board
    at 9 a.m. I felt certain the article would be all right.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. And it wasn't all right.</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>positively</i>

    ). Perfectly all right.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. You don't seem quite sure. Are we still in the
    realm of fact, or are we slipping over the frontier?</p>

    <p>

    TRANTO. The article was perfectly all right. It rattled off
    from beginning to end like a machine-gun, and must have caused
    enormous casualties. Only I thought Auntie Joe might be one of
    the casualties. I thought it might put her out of action as a
    hostess for a week or so. You see, for me to publish such an
    onslaught on new titles in the afternoon, and then attempt to
    dine with the latest countess the same night&#8212;and she my
    own aunt&#8212;well, it might be regarded as a bit&#8212;thick.
    So I'm confined to the house&#8212;this house as it
    happens.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. But you told John your people would take the
    article like meat and drink.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. What if I did? John can't expect to discover the
    whole truth about everything at one go. He's found out it's a
    jolly strange world. That ought to satisfy him for to-day.
    Besides, he only asked me about my uncles. He said nothing
    about my uncles' wives. You know what women are&#8212;I mean
    wives.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Oh, I do! Mother is a marvellous specimen.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I haven't told you the worst.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. I hope no man ever will.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. The worst is this. Auntie Joe actually thinks
    <i>I</i>

    'm Sampson Straight.</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 19 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page021" name="page021">[pg 21]</a>
    </span>

    HILDEGARDE. She doesn't!</p>

    <p>TRANTO. She does. She has an infinite capacity for belief.
    The psychology of the thing is as follows. My governor died a
    comparatively poor man. A couple of hundred thousand pounds,
    more or less. Whereas Uncle Joe is worth five
    millions&#8212;and Uncle Joe was going to adopt me, when Auntie
    Joe butted in and married him. She used to arrange the flowers
    for his first wife. Then she arranged
    <i>his</i>

    flowers. Then she became a flower herself and he had to gather
    her. Then she had twins, and my chances of inheriting that five
    millions (
    <i>he imitates the noise of a slight explosion</i>

    ) short-circuited! Well, I didn't care a volt&#8212;not a volt!
    I've got lots of uncles left who are quite capable of adopting
    me. But I didn't really want to be adopted at all. To adopt me
    was only part of Uncle Joe's political game. It was my
    <i>Echo</i>

    that he was after adopting. But I'd sooner run my
    <i>Echo</i>

    on my own than inherit Uncle Joe's controlling share in
    twenty-five daily papers, seventy-one weekly papers, six
    monthly magazines, and three independent advertising agencies.
    I know I'm a poor man, but I'm quite ready to go on facing the
    world bravely with my modest capital of a couple of hundred
    thousand pounds. Only Auntie Joe can't understand that. She's
    absolutely convinced that I have a terrific grudge against her
    and her twins, and that in order to
<!-- Page 20 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page022" name="page022">[pg 22]</a>
    </span>

    gratify that grudge I myself personally write articles against
    all her most sacred ideals under the pseudonym of Sampson
    Straight. I've pointed out to her that I'm a newspaper
    proprietor, and no newspaper proprietor ever
    <i>could</i>

    write. No use! She won't listen.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Then she thinks you're a liar.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Oh, not at all. Only a journalist. But you perceive
    the widening rift in the family lute. (
    <i>A silence</i>

    .) Pardon this glimpse into the secret history of the week.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>formidably</i>

    ). Mr. Tranto, you and I are sitting on the edge of a
    volcano.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. We are. I like it. Thrilling, and yet so warm and
    cosy.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. I used to like it once. But I don't think I like
    it any more.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Now please don't let Auntie Joe worry you. She's my
    cross, not yours.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Yes. But considered as a cross, your Auntie Joe
    is nothing to my brother John, who quite justly calls his
    sister's cookery stuff 'tripe.' It was a most ingenious
    camouflage of yours to have me pretending to be the author of
    that food economy 'tripe,' so as to cover my writing quite
    different articles for
    <i>The Echo</i>

    and

    your coming here to see me so often. Most ingenious. Worthy of
    a newspaper proprietor. But why should I be saddled with
    'tripe' that isn't mine?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Why, indeed! Then you think we ought to encourage
    the volcano with a lighted match&#8212;and run?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. I'm ready if you are.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Oh! I'm ready. Secrecy was a great stunt at first.
    Letting out the secret will be an even greater stunt now. It'll
    make the finest newspaper story since the fearful fall of the
    last Cabinet. Sampson Straight&#8212;equals Miss Hildegarde
    Culver, the twenty-one year old daughter of the Controller of
    Accounts! Typist in the Food Department, by day! Journalistic
    genius by night! The terror of Ministers! Read by all London!
    Raised the circulation of
    <i>The Echo</i>

    two hundred per cent! Phenomenon unique in the annals of Fleet
    Street! (
    <i>In a different tone, noticing</i>

    Hildegarde's
    <i>face</i>

    ). Crude headlines, I admit, but that's what Uncle Joe has
    brought us to. We have to compete with Uncle Joe....</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Of course I shall have to leave home.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Leave home!</p>

    HILDEGARDE. Yes, and live by myself in rooms.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. But why?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. I couldn't possibly stay here. Think how it
    would compromise father with the War Cabinet if I did. It might
    ruin him. And as accounts are everything in modern warfare, it
    might lose the war. But that's nothing&#8212;it's mamma I'm
    thinking of. Do you forget that Sampson Straight, being a young
    woman of advanced ideas, has written about everything,
    <i>everything</i>

    &#8212;yes, and several other subjects besides? For instance,
    here's the article I was revising when you came in. (
    <i>Shows the title-page to</i>

    Tranto.)</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Splendid! You're the most courageous creature I ever
    met.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Possibly. But not courageous enough to offer to
    kiss mamma when I went to bed on the night that
    <i>that (indicating the article</i>

    ) had appeared in print under my own name. You don't know
    mamma.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. But dash it! You could eat your mother!</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Pardon me. The contrary is the fact. Mamma could
    eat me.</p>

    <p>

    TRANTO. But you're the illustrious Sampson Straight. There's
    more intelligence in your little finger than there is in your
    mother's whole body. See how you write.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Write! I only began to write as a relief from
    mamma. I escaped secretly into articles like escaping into an
    underground passage. But as for facing mamma in the open!...
    Even father scarcely ever does that; and when he does, we hold
    our breath, and the cook turns teetotal. It wouldn't be the
    slightest use me trying to explain the situation logically to
    mamma. She wouldn't understand. She's far too clever to
    understand anything she doesn't like. Perhaps that's the secret
    of her power. No, if the truth about Sampson Straight is to
    come out I must leave home&#8212;quietly but firmly leave home.
    And why not? I can keep myself in splendour on Sampson's
    earnings. And the break is bound to come sooner or later. I
    admit I didn't begin very seriously, but reading my own
    articles has gradually made me serious. I feel I have a cause.
    A cause may be inconvenient, but it's magnificent. It's like
    champagne or high heels, and one must be prepared to suffer for
    it.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Cause be hanged! Suffer be hanged! High heels be
    hanged! Champagne&#8212;(
    <i>stops</i>

    ). Miss Culver, if a disclosure means your leaving

    will&#8212;not&#8212;agree. We'll sit tight on the volcano.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. But why won't you agree?</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>excited</i>

    ). Why won't I agree! Why won't I agree! Because I don't want
    you to leave home. I know you're a born genius&#8212;a marvel,
    a miracle, a prodigy, an incredible orchid, the most brilliant
    journalist in London. I'm fully aware of all that. But I do not
    and will not see you as a literary bachelor living with a cause
    and holding receptions of serious people in chambers furnished
    by Roger Fry. I like to think of you at home, here, in this
    charming atmosphere, amid the delightful vicissitudes of family
    existence, and&#8212;well, I like to think of you as a
    woman.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (

    slave-drives my poor husband. Please do excuse me. (
    <i>She sits</i>

    ).</p>

    <p>TRANTO. On the contrary, it's I who should ask to be
    excused&#8212;proposing myself like this at the last
    moment.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. It was very nice of you to think of us. Come
    and sit down here. (
    <i>Indicating a place by her side on the sofa</i>

    for to-night at your aunt's, Lady Blackfriars'.</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>sitting</i>

    <i>was</i>

    engaged for Auntie Joe's, but she's ill and she's put me
    off.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Dear me! How very sudden!</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Sudden?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. I met Lady Blackfriars at tea late this
    afternoon and it struck me how well she was looking.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Yes, she always looks particularly well just before
    she's going to be ill. She's very brave, very brave.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. D'you mean in having twins? It was more than
    brave of her; it was beautiful&#8212;both boys, too.</p>

    Excuse me, Mr. Tranto.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (

    <p>MRS. CULVER. I do wish you would let me see those cookery
    articles of yours before they're printed.</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>putting MS. in his pocket</i>

    ). I'm afraid that's quite against the rules. You see, in Fleet
    Street&#8212;</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>very pleasantly</i>

    ). As you please. I don't pretend to be intellectual. But I
    confess I'm just a wee bit disappointed in Hildegarde's cookery
    articles. I'm a great believer in good cookery. I put it next
    to the Christian religion&#8212;and far in front of mere
    cleanliness. I've just been trying to read Professor
    Metchnikoff's wonderful book on 'The Nature of Man.' It
<!-- Page 27 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page029" name="page029">[pg 29]</a>
    </span>

    only confirms me in my lifelong belief that until the nature of
    man is completely altered good cooking is the chief thing that
    women ought to understand. Now I taught Hildegarde some cookery
    myself. She was not what I should call a brilliant pupil, but
    she did grasp the great eternal principles. And yet I find her
    writing (
    <i>with charm and benevolence</i>

    ) stuff like her last article&#8212;'The Everlasting Boiled
    Potato,' I think she called it. Hildegarde, it was really very
    naughty of you to say what you said in that article. (
    <i>Drawing down</i>

    Hildegarde's
    <i>head and kissing her</i>

    .)</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Now why, Mrs. Culver? I thought it was so
    clever.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. It may be clever to advocate fried potatoes and
    chip potatoes and saut&#233; potatoes as a change from the
    everlasting boiled. I daresay it's what you call journalism.
    But how can you fry potatoes without fat?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Ah! How?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. And where are you to obtain fat?
    <i>I</i>

    can't obtain fat. I stand in queues for hours because my
    servants won't&#8212;it's the latest form of
    democracy&#8212;but
    <i>I</i>

    can't obtain fat. I think the nearest fat is at
    Stratford-on-Avon.</p>

    guilty, plunging in at a

    world. I shall eat nothing but dry bread.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. We never serve bread at lunch or dinner unless
    it's specially asked for. But if soup, macaroni, eggs, and
    jelly will keep you alive till breakfast&#8212;</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. But there's beefsteak, mamma&#8212;I've told Mr.
    Tranto.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Only a little, and that's for your father.
    Beefsteak's the one thing that keeps off his neuralgia, Mr.
    Tranto. (

    .) I'm sure you'll understand.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Dear lady, I've never had neuralgia in my life.
    Macaroni, eggs, and jelly are my dream. I've always wanted to
    feel like an invalid.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. And how did you get on with your Medical Board
    this morning?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. How marvellous of you to remember that I had a
    Medical Board this morning! I believe I've found out your
    secret, Mrs. Culver&#8212;you're undergoing a course of Pelman
    with those sixty generals and forty admirals. Well, the Medical
    Board have given me a new complaint. You'll be sorry to hear

    TRANTO. Yes. It appears I'm flat-footed. (
    <i>Extending his leg</i>

    .) Have I ever told you that I had a dashing military career
    extending over four months, three of which I spent in hospital
    for a disease I hadn't got? Then I was discharged as unfit.
    After a year they raked me in again. Since then I've been
    boarded five times, and on the unimpeachable authority of
    various R.A.M.C. Colonels I've been afflicted with valvular
    disease of the heart, incipient tuberculosis, rickets, varicose
    veins, diabetes&#8212;practically everything, except spotted
    fever and leprosy. And now flat feet are added to all the rest.
    Even the Russian collapse and the transfer of the entire German
    army to the Western Front hasn't raised me higher than C 3.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. How annoying for you! You might have risen to
    be a captain by this time.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>reflectively</i>

    would still have been a second lieutenant.</p>

    things. John will soon be eighteen, and his father and I want

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Arthur, have you come?</p>

    <p>CULVER (

    <p>MRS. CULVER (

    when something's gone wrong. (

    <p>MRS. CULVER (

    <p>CULVER. But what about the war, darling?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (

    shall do. I shall just go&#8212;</p>

    <p>CULVER. Yes, darling, just go and suggest a short armistice
    to the Germans while you take me to Brighton for a week's
    fondling.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. I shall just speak to Miss Starkey. Strange
    that the wife, in order to influence the husband, should have
    to appeal to (
    <i>disdainfully</i>

    depend upon her absolutely. First, Miss Starkey is the rock
    upon which my official existence is built. She is a serious and
    conscientious rock. She is hard and expects me to be hard.
    Secondly, Miss Starkey is the cushion between me and the world.
    She knows my tender spots, and protects them. Thirdly, Miss
    Starkey is my rod&#8212;and I kiss it.</p>

    MRS. CULVER (

    ). You mean they're going to ask you to resign?</p>

    <p>CULVER. I wish they would!</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Arthur! Do please remember the country is at
    war.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Is it? So it is. You see, my pet, I remember such a
    lot of things. I remember that my brainy partner is counting
    khaki trousers in the Army clothing department. I remember that
    my other partner ought to be in a lunatic asylum, but isn't. I
    remember that my business is going to the dogs at a muzzle
    velocity of about five thousand feet a second. I remember that
    from mere snobbishness I work for the Government without a
    penny of salary, and that my sole reward is to be insulted and
    libelled by high-brow novelists who write for the press.
    Therefore you ought not to be startled if I secretly yearn to
    resign. However, I shall not be asked to resign. I said that
    the Government had been in a very serious situation. It was.
    But it will soon recover.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. How soon?</p>

    <p>CULVER. On New Year's Day.</p>

    CULVER. No. But I've seen something special. I saw it less than
    an hour ago. It was shown to me without the slightest warning,
    and I admit it shook me. You can perceive for yourselves that
    it shook me.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. But what?</p>

    <p>CULVER. The New Year's Honours List&#8212;or rather a few

    <p>JOHN (
    <i>impatient of this feminine manifestation</i>

    ). Oh, dad, go on. Go on! I want to get at the bottom of this
    titles business. I'm hanged if I can understand it. What
    strikes me as an unprejudiced observer is that titles are
    supposed to be such a terrific honour, and yet the people who
    deal them out scarcely ever keep any for themselves. Look at
    Mr. Gladstone, for instance. He must have made about forty
    earls and seven thousand baronets in his time. Now if I was a

    Prime Minister, and I believed in titles&#8212;which I jolly
    well don't&#8212;I should make myself a duke right off; and I
    should have several marquises and viscounts round me in the
    Cabinet like a sort of bodyguard, and my private secretaries
    would have to be knights. There'd be some logic in that
    arrangement anyhow.</p>

    <p>CULVER. In view of your political career, John, will you
    mind if I give you a brief lesson on elementary
    politics&#8212;though you

    <p>CULVER. What is the first duty of modern Governments?</p>

    <p>JOHN. To govern.</p>

    <p>CULVER. My innocent boy. I thought better of you. I know
    that you look on the venerable Mr. Tranto as a back number, and
    I suspect that Mr. Tranto in his turn regards me as
    prehistoric; and yet you are so behind the times as to imagine
    that the first duty of modern Governments is to govern! My dear
    Rip van Winkle, wake up. The first duty of a Government is to
    live. It has no right to be a Government at all unless it is
    convinced that if it fell the country would go to everlasting
    smash. Hence its first duty is to survive. In order to survive
    it must do three

    things&#8212;placate certain interests, influence votes, and
    obtain secret funds. All these three things can be accomplished
    by the ingenious institution of Honours. Only the simple-minded
    believe that Honours are given to honour. Honours are given to
    save the life of the Government. Hence the Honours List.
    Examine the Honours List and you can instantly tell how the
    Government feels in its inside. When the Honours List is full
    of rascals, millionaires, and&#8212;er&#8212;chumps, you may be
    quite sure that the Government is dangerously ill.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. But that amounts to what we've been saying in
    <i>The Echo</i>

    clearly, in every case of an Honour, exactly what services the
    Honour is given for. This (

    CULVER. Of course. There have to be some nice names, for the
    sake of the psychological effect on the public mind on New
    Year's Day. The public looks for a good name, or for a name it
    can understand. It skims down the List till it sees one. Then
    it says: 'Ah! That's not so bad!' Then it skims down further
    till it sees another one, and it says again: 'Ah! That's not so
    bad!' And so on. So that with about five or six decent names
    you can produce the illusion that after all the List is really
    rather good.</p>

    TRANTO (
    <i>temporising, lightly</i>

    ). You remind me of the man with the pistol.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Is it Hildegarde?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. How did you guess?</p>

    <p>CULVER. Well; first, I knew my daughter couldn't be the
    piffling lunatic who does your war cookery articles. Second, I
    asked myself: What reason has she for pretending to be that
    piffling lunatic? Third, I have an exceedingly high opinion of
    my daughter's brains. Fourth, she gave a funny start just now
    when I mentioned the idea of Sampson Straight going to the
    Tower.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Perhaps I ought to explain&#8212;</p>

    <p>CULVER. No you oughn't. There's no time. I simply wanted a
    bit of information. I've got it. Now I have a bit of
    information for you. I've been offered a place in this
    beautiful Honours List. Baronetcy! Me! I am put on the same
    high plane as Mr. James Brill, the unspeakable. The formal
    offer hasn't actually arrived&#8212;it's late; I expect the
    letter'll be here in the morning&#8212;but I know for a fact
    I'm in the List for a baronetcy.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Well, I congratulate you.</p>

    <p>CULVER. You'd better not.</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 48 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page050" name="page050">[pg 50]</a>
    </span>

    TRANTO. You deserve more than a baronetcy. Your department has
    been a striking success&#8212;one of the very few in the whole
    length of Whitehall.</p>

    <p>CULVER. I know my department has been a success. But that's
    not why I'm offered a baronetcy. Good heavens, I haven't even
    spoken to any member of the War Cabinet yet. I've been trying
    to for about a year, but in spite of powerful influences to
    help me I've never been able to bring off a meeting with the
    mandarins. No! I'm offered a baronetcy because I'm respectable;
    I'm decent; and at the last moment they thought the List looked
    a bit too thick&#8212;so they pushed me in. One of their
    brilliant afterthoughts!... No damned merit about the thing, I
    can tell you!</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Do you mean you intend to refuse?</p>

    <p>CULVER. Do you mean you ever imagined that I should accept?
    Me, in the same galley with Brill&#8212;who daren't go into his
    own clubs&#8212;and Ullivant, and a few more pretty nearly as
    bad! Of course, I shall refuse. Nothing on earth would induce
    me to accept. Nothing! (
    <i>More calmly</i>

    .) Mind you, I don't blame the Government; probably the
    Government can't help itself. Therefore the Government must be
    helped; and sometimes the best way to help a fellow creature is
    to bring him to his senses by catching him one across the
    jaw.</p>

    TRANTO. Why are you making a secret of it? The offer is surely
    bound to come out.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Of course. I'm only making a secret of it for the
    moment, while I prepare the domestic ground for my refusal.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. You wish me to understand&#8212;</p>

    <p>CULVER. You know what women are. (
    <i>With caution</i>

    <p>TRANTO. I see.</p>

    <p>CULVER. That's all right.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Well, if I mayn't congratulate you on the title, let
    me congratulate you on your marvellous skill in this delicate
    operation of preparing the domestic ground for your refusal of
    the title. Your success is complete, absolute.</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>sardonic</i>

    .) Complete? Absolute?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. You have&#8212;er&#8212;jockeyed
    Mrs.&#8212;er&#8212;the sex into committing itself quite
    definitely against titles. Hence I look on your position as
    impregnable.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Good heavens, Tranto! How old are you?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Twenty-five.</p>

    CULVER. A quarter of a century&#8212;and you haven't learnt
    that no position is impregnable against&#8212;er&#8212;the sex!
    You never know where the offensive will come, nor when, nor
    how. The offensive is bound to be a surprise. You aren't
    married. When you are you'll soon find out that being a husband
    is a whole-time job. That's why so many husbands fail. They
    can't give their entire attention to it. Tranto, my position
    must be still further strengthened&#8212;during dinner. It
    can't be strengthened too much. I've brought you into the
    conspiracy because you're on the spot and I want you to play
    up.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Certainly, sir.</p>

    <p>CULVER. The official letter
    <i>might</i>

    come by to-night's post. If it does, a considerable amount of
    histrionic skill will be needed.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Trust me for that.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Oh! I do! Indeed I fancy after all I'm fairly safe.
    There's only one danger.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Yes?</p>

    it was last week&#8212;you and I were walking down Bond Street,
    almost hand in hand, but not quite, and you saw a brooch in a
    shop window. You simply had to have that brooch. I offered it

    <p>CULVER. You are. And I'm a boy. I say we are absurd. We're
    continually absurd. We were absurd all last evening when we
    pretended before the others, with the most disastrous results,
    that nothing was the matter. We were still more absurd when we
    went to our twin beds and argued savagely with each other from
    bed to bed until four o'clock this morning. Do you know that I
    had exactly one hour and fifty-five minutes' sleep? (
    <i>Yawns</i>

    my office to-day has practically lost the war? But the most

    <p>CULVER. Quite. But I also see the force of mine, and, as an
    impartial judge, I'm bound to say that yours aren't in it with
    mine.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Then you've refused the title after all?</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>ingratiatingly</i>

    MRS. CULVER. Surely it has occurred to you&#8212;</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>firmly, but very pleasantly</i>

    ). Stop! You had till four o'clock this morning to deliver all
    your arguments. You aren't going to begin again. I understand
    you've stayed in bed all day. Quite right! But if you stayed in
    bed merely to think of fresh arguments while I've been slaving
    away at the office for my country, I say you're taking an
    unfair advantage of me, and I won't have it.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>with dignity</i>

    say what they were.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Oh! Why?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Because I can see it's useless to argue with a
    man like you.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Now that's what I call better news from the
    Front.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. I was only going to say this. Surely it has
    occurred to you that on patriotic grounds alone you oughtn't to
    refuse the title. I quite agree that Honours have been
    degraded. Quite! The thing surely is to try and make them
    respectable again. And how are they ever to be respectable if
    respectable men refuse them?</p>

    CULVER. This looks to me suspiciously like an argument.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Not at all. It's simply a question.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Well, the answer is, I don't want Honours to be
    respectable any more. Proverb: When fish has gone bad ten
    thousand decent men can't take away the stink.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Now you're insulting your country. I know you
    often pretend your country's the slackest place on earth, but
    it's only pretence. You don't really think so. The truth is
    that inside you you're positively conceited about your country.
    You think it's the greatest country that ever was. And so it
    is. And yet when your country offers you this honour you talk
    about bad fish. I say it's an insult to Great Britain.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Great Britain hasn't offered me any title. The fact
    is that there are a couple of shrewd fellows up a devil of a
    tree in Whitehall, and they're waving a title at me in the hope
    that I shall come and stand under the tree so that they can get
    down by putting their dirty boots on my shoulders. Well, I'm
    not going to be a ladder.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. You might be serious for once.</p>

    <p>CULVER. I am serious. Beneath this amusing and delightful
    exterior, there is hidden the most serious, determined,
    resolute, relentless, inexorable, immovable man that ever
    breathed. And let me tell you something else, my
    girl&#8212;something I haven't mentioned before because of my
    nice feelings. What has this title affair got to do with you?
    What the dickens has it got to do with you? The title isn't
    offered as a reward for
    <i>your</i>

    work; it's offered as a reward for
    <i>my</i>

    work.
    <i>You</i>

    aren't the Controller of Accounts,
    <i>I</i>

    happen to be the Controller of Accounts. I have decided to
    refuse the title, and I shall refuse it.
    <i>Nothing will induce me to accept it</i>

    . Do I make myself clear, or (
    <i>smiling affectionately</i>

    ) am I lost in a mist of words?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>suddenly furious</i>

    ). You are a brute. You always were. You never think of anybody
    but yourself. My life has been one long sacrifice, and you know
    it perfectly well. Perfectly well! You talk about
    <i>your</i>

    work. What about my work? Why! You'd be utterly useless without
    me. You can't even look after your own collars. Could you go
    down to your ridiculous

    ). Let me alone! I told you at the start I should never give
    way. And I never will. Never! If you send that letter of
    refusal, do you know what I shall do? I shall go and see the
    War Cabinet myself. I shall tell them you don't mean it. I'll

    HILDEGARDE (
    <i>seeing the room empty</i>

    ). Well, I thought I heard them.</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>catching noise of high words from the boudoir</i>

    .) I fancy I
    <i>do</i>

    hear them.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Perhaps we'd better go.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. But I want to speak to you&#8212;just for a
    moment.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>moving uneasily</i>

    ). What about?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I don't know. Anything. It doesn't matter what ... I
    don't hear them now.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>listening and hearing nothing; reassured</i>

    ). I should have thought you wouldn't have wanted to come here
    any more for a long time.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Why?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. After the terrible experiences of last night,
    during dinner and after dinner.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. The general constraint?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. The general constraint.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. The awkwardness?

    HILDEGARDE. The awkwardness.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. The frightful silences and the forced
    conversations?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>nods</i>

    ). Why
    <i>did</i>

    you come?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Well&#8212;</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. I suppose you're still confined to this
    house.</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>in a new confidential tone</i>

    ). I wish you'd treat me as your father does.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. But of course I will&#8212;</p>

    <p>TRANTO. That's fine. He treats me as an intimate friend.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. But you must treat me as you treat papa.</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>slightly dashed</i>

    ). I'll try. I might tell you that I had two very straight
    talks with your father last night.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Two?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Yes; one before dinner, and the other just before I
    left&#8212;when you'd gone to bed. He began them&#8212;both of
    them.</p>

    HILDEGARDE. Oh! So that you may be said to know the whole
    situation.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Yes. Up to last thing last night, that is.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Since then it's developed on normal lines. What
    do you think of it?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I adore your mother, but I think your father's quite
    right.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Well, naturally! I take that for granted. I was
    expecting something rather more original.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. You shall have it. I think that you and I are very
    largely responsible for the situation. I think our joint
    responsibility binds us inextricably together.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Mr. Tranto!</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Certainly. There's no doubt in my mind that your
    father was enormously influenced by Sampson Straight's article
    on the Honours scandal. In fact he told me so. And seeing that
    you wrote it and I published it&#8212;</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>alarmed</i>

    ). You didn't tell him I'm Sampson Straight?
<!-- Page 66 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page069" name="page069">[pg 69]</a>
    </span>

    TRANTO. Can you imagine me doing such a thing?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. I hope not. Shall I tell you what
    <i>I</i>

    think of the situation?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I wish you would.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. I think such situations would never arise if
    parents weren't so painfully unromantic. I'm not speaking
    particularly of papa and mamma. I mean all parents. But take
    mamma. She's absolutely matter-of-fact. And papa's nearly as
    bad. Of course I know they're always calling each other by pet
    names; but that's mere camouflage for their matter-of-factness.
    Whereas if they both had in them a little of the real romance
    of life&#8212;everything would be different. At the same time I
    needn't say that in this affair that we're now in the middle
    of&#8212;there's no question of ratiocination.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Of what?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Ratiocination. Reasoning. On either side.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Oh no!</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. It's simply a question of mutual attitude, isn't
    it? Now, if only&#8212;. But there!

    What's the use? Parents are like that, poor dears! They have
    forgotten! (
    <i>With emphasis</i>

    .) They have forgotten&#8212;what makes life worth living.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. You mean, for instance, your mother never sits on
    your father's knee.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>bravely, after hesitation</i>

    ). Yes! Crudely&#8212;that's what I do mean.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Miss Hildegarde, you are the most marvellous girl I
    ever met. You are, really! You seem to combine all qualities.
    It's amazing to me. I'm more and more astounded. Every time I
    come here there's a fresh revelation. Now you mention romance.
    I'm glad you mentioned it first. But I
    <i>saw</i>

    it first. I saw it in your eyes the first time I ever met you.
    Yes! Miss Hilda, do you see it in mine? Look. Look closely. (
    <i>Approaching her</i>

    .) Because it's there. I must tell you. I can't wait any
    longer. (
    <i>Feeling for her hand, vainly</i>

    .)</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (

    HILDEGARDE. What am I to do?</p>

    <p>CULVER. I don't know. (

    that.</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>turning to</i>

    Tranto). My dear fellow, the war is practically over.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Good heavens! There was nothing on the tape when I
    left the Club.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Oh! I don't mean your war. I mean the twenty-two
    years' war.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. The twenty-two years' war?</p>

    <p>CULVER. My married life. Over! Finished! Napoo!</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Do you know what you're saying?</p>

    <p>CULVER. Look here, Tranto. You and I don't belong to the
    same generation. In fact, if I'd started early enough I might
    have been your father. But we got so damned intimate last
    night, and I'm in such a damned hole, and you're so damned
    wise, that I feel I must talk to you. Not that it'll be any
    use.</p>

    TRANTO. But what's the matter?</p>

    <p>CULVER. The matter is&#8212;keeping a woman in the
    house.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Mr. Culver! You don't mean&#8212;</p>

    <p>CULVER. I mean my wife&#8212;of course. I've just had the
    most ghastly rumpus with my wife. It was divided into two acts.
    The first took place here, the second in the boudoir (
    <i>indicating boudoir</i>

    ). The second act was the shortest but the worst.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. But what was it all about?</p>

    <p>CULVER. Now for heaven's sake don't ask silly questions. You
    know perfectly well what it was about. It was about the
    baronetcy. I have decided to refuse that baronetcy, and my wife
    has refused to let me refuse it.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. But what are her arguments?</p>

    <p>CULVER. I've implored you once not to ask silly questions.
    'What are her arguments' indeed! She hasn't got any arguments.
    You know that. You're too wise not to know it. She merely wants
    the title, that's all.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. And how did the second act end?</p>

    <p>CULVER. I don't quite remember.</p>

    </span>

    TRANTO. Let me suggest that you sit down. (Culver
    <i>sits</i>

    .) Thanks. Now I've always gathered from my personal
    observation, that you, if I may say so, are the top dog here
    when it comes to the point&#8212;the crowned head, as it
    were.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. At least,
    it did last night, and I shall be greatly surprised if it
    doesn't to-night.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Naturally. A crown isn't a night-cap. But you are
    the top dog. In the last resort, what you say, goes. That is
    so, isn't it? I only want to be clear.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Yes, I think that's pretty right.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Well, you have decided on public grounds, and as a
    question of principle, to refuse the title. You intend to
    refuse it.</p>

    <p>CULVER. I&#8212;I do.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Nobody can stop you from refusing it.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Nobody.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Mrs. Culver can't stop you from refusing it?</p>

    <p>CULVER. Certainly not. It concerns me alone.</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 71 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page074" name="page074">[pg 74]</a>
    </span>

    TRANTO. Well, then, where is the difficulty? A rumpus&#8212;I
    think you said. What of that? My dear Mr. Culver, believe me, I
    have seen far more of marriage than you have. You're only a
    married man. I'm a bachelor, and I've assisted at scores of
    married lives. A rumpus is nothing. It passes&#8212;and leaves
    the victor more firmly established than ever before.</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>rising</i>

    ). Don't talk to me of rumpuses. I know all about rumpuses.
    This one is an arch-rumpus. This one is like no other rumpus
    that ever was. It's something new in my vast experience. I
    shall win. I have won. But at what cost? (
    <i>With effect</i>

    .) The cost may be that I shall never kiss the enemy again. The
    whole domestic future is in grave jeopardy.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Seriously?</p>

    <p>CULVER. Seriously.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Then you musn't win.</p>

    <p>CULVER. But what about my public duty? What about my
    principles? I can't sacrifice my principles.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Why not?</p>

    <p>CULVER. I never have.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. How old are you?</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 72 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page075" name="page075">[pg 75]</a>
    </span>

    CULVER. Forty-four.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. And you've never sacrificed a principle?</p>

    <p>CULVER. Never.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Then it's high time you began. And you'd better
    begin, before it's too late. Besides, there are no principles
    in married life.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Tranto, you are remarkable. How did you find that
    out?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I've often noticed it.</p>

    <p>CULVER. It's a profound truth. It throws a new light on the
    entire situation.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. It does.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Then you deliberately advise me to give way about
    the title?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I do.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Strange! (
    <i>Casually</i>

    .) I had thought of doing so, but I never dreamt you'd agree,
    and I'd positively determined to act on your advice. You know,
    you're taking an immense responsibility.</p>

    TRANTO. I can bear that. What I couldn't bear is any kind of
    real trouble in this house.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Why? What's it got to do with you?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Nothing! Nothing! Only my abstract interest in the
    institution of marriage.</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>ringing the bell twice</i>

    ). Ah, well, after all, I'm not utterly beaten yet. I've quite
    half an hour before post goes, and I shall fight to the last
    ditch.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. But hasn't Mrs. Culver retired?</p>

    <p>CULVER. Yes.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. May I suggest that it would be mistaken tactics
    to&#8212;er&#8212;run after her?</p>

    <p>CULVER. It would.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Well then?</p>

    <p>CULVER. She will return.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. How do you know?</p>

    <p>CULVER. She always does.... No, Tranto, I may yet get peace
    on my own terms. You see I'm an accountant. No ordinary people,
    accountants!

    CULVER. Young woman, you know that you are absolutely
    indispensable to me. You know that without you I should
    practically cease to exist. I am quite open with you as to
    that&#8212;and as to everything. You are acquainted with the
    very depths of my character and the most horrible secrets of my
    life. I conceal nothing from you, and I demand that you conceal
    nothing from me. What are your reasons for giving me notice in
    this manner?</p>

    <p>MISS STARKEY. My self respect would not allow me to remain
    with a gentleman who had refused a title. Oh, Mr. Culver, to be
    the private secretary to a baronet has been my life's dream.
    And&#8212;and&#8212;I have just had the offer of a place where
    a
    <i>peerage</i>

    is in prospect. Still, I wouldn't have, taken even that if you
    had not&#8212;if you had not&#8212;(

    conclusion&#8212;all women are alike.</p>

    inconvenience, because you'll easily get another girl exactly

    MRS. CULVER (
    <i>very sweetly</i>

    ), Arthur, I was wrong.</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>startled</i>

    ). Good God! (Mrs. Culver
    <i>bends down to examine the upholstery of a chair</i>

    . Culver
    <i>gives a gesture, first of triumph, and then of
    apprehension</i>

    .)</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>looking straight at him</i>

    ). I say I was wrong.</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>lightly, but uneasily</i>

    ). Oh no! Oh no!</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Of course I don't mean wrong in my arguments
    about the title. Not for a moment. I mean I was wrong not to
    sacrifice my own point of view. I'm only a woman, and it's the
    woman's place to submit. So I do submit. Naturally I shall
    always be a true wife to you, but&#8212;</p>

    <p>CULVER. Now child, don't begin to talk like that. I don't
    mind
    <i>reading</i>

    novels, but I won't have raw lumps of them thrown
    <i>at</i>

    me.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>with a gentle smile</i>

    ), I
    <i>must</i>

    talk like this. I shall do everything I can to make you
    comfortable, and I hope nobody, and especially not the poor
    children, will notice any difference in our relations.</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>advancing, with a sort of menace</i>

    ). But?</p>

    MRS. CULVER. But things can never be the same again.</p>

    <p>CULVER. I knew the confounded phrase was coming. I knew it.
    I've read it scores of times. (
    <i>Picking up the vase</i>

    .) Hermione, if you continue in that strain, I will dash this
    vase into a thousand fragments.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>quietly taking the vase from him and putting it down</i>

    ). Arthur, I could have forgiven you everything. What do I
    care&#8212;really&#8212;about a title? (
    <i>Falsely</i>

    .) I only care for your happiness. But I can't forgive you for
    having laid a trap for me last night&#8212;and in front of the
    children and a stranger too.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Laid a trap for you?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. You knew all about the title when you first
    came in last night and you deliberately led me on.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Oh! That! Ah well! One does what one can. You've
    laid many a trap for me, my girl. You're still about ten up and
    two to play in the trap game.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. I've never laid a trap for you.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Fibster! Come here. (Mrs. Culver
    <i>hesitates</i>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>having moved away; still very sweetly and coldly</i>

    ). Can I do anything else for you before I go to bed?</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>ignoring the question; grandly and tolerantly</i>

    ). Do you suppose, my marble statue, that after all I've said
    at the Club about the rascality of this Honours business, I
    could ever have appeared there as a New Year Baronet? The
    thing's unthinkable. Why, I should have had to resign and join
    another Club!</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>calmly and severely</i>

    ). So that's it, is it? I might have known what was really at
    the bottom of it all. Your Club again! You have to choose
    between your wife and your Club, and of course it's your wife
    that must suffer. Naturally!</p>

    <p>CULVER. Go on! You'll be saying next that I've committed
    bigamy with my Club.</p>

    CULVER (

    hair was still down. The marvel to me is that I ever let you
    put it up.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. I'm only an old woman now. You have had the
    best part of my life. You might have given me great pleasure
    with this title. But no! Your Club comes first. And what a
    child you are! As if there's one single member of your Club who
    wouldn't envy you your baronetcy! However, I've nothing more to
    say. (
    <i>Moving towards the door, back</i>

    .) Oh yes, I have. (
    <i>Casually</i>

    .) I've decided to go away to-morrow and stay with grandma for
    a long holiday. She needs me, and if I'm not to break down
    entirely I must have a change. I've told Hildegarde
    our&#8212;arrangements. The poor girl's terribly upset. Please
    don't disturb me in the morning. I shall take the noon train.
    Good-night.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Hermione!</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>returning a little from the direction of the door,

    MRS. CULVER (

    <p>CULVER. I have no conscience. Never had.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>persuasively, and with much charm</i>

    sensible little wife. You know you're only bluffing.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Indeed I'm not.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Yes, you are. Mr. Tranto advised you to give
    way, and you think such a lot of his opinion.</p>

    pater ought to have a night to think over this affair. It's
    very important. And he can easily send round an answer by hand
    in the morning.' So I didn't post the letter. I should have

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Of course it isn't settled. Mother darling, we

    attitude of the modern girl towards things that affect her
    convictions.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>sweetly</i>

    ). Are you the modern girl.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Yes.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Well, I'm the ancient girl. And I can tell you
    this&#8212;you're very like me, and we're both very like
    somebody else.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Who's that.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Eve.</p>

    <p>JOHN. Come, mater. Eve would never have learnt typewriting.
    She'd have gone on the land.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. John, your sister and I are not jesting.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. I'm so glad you admit I'm serious, mamma.
    Because I am&#8212;very. I don't want to threaten&#8212;</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Threaten, darling?</p>

    HILDEGARDE (
    <i>firmly, but quite lightly and sweetly</i>

    ). No, darling.
    <i>Not</i>

    to threaten. The mere idea of threatening is absurd. But it
    would be extremely unfair to you not to tell you that unless
    you agree to father refusing the title, I shall have to leave
    the house and live by myself. I really shall. Of course I can
    easily earn my own living. I quite see that you have
    principles. But I also have principles. If they
    clash&#8212;naturally it's my place to retire. And I shall,
    mamma dearest.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Is that final?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Final, mummy darling.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Then, my dearest child, you must go.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>still sweetly</i>

    ). Is that final?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (

    ). Final, my poor pet.</p>

    <p>JOHN (
    <i>firmly</i>

    ). Now let
    <i>me</i>

    say a word.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>benignly</i>

    ). And what have you got to say in the matter? You've already
    been very naughty about that letter. Do try not to be
    ridiculous. Give me the letter. This affair has nothing to do
    with you.

    JOHN (
    <i>putting the letter in his pocket</i>

    ). Nothing whatever to do with me! Mater, you really are a bit
    too thick. If it was a knighthood, I wouldn't care. You could
    have your blooming knighthood. Knighthoods do come to an end.
    Baronetcies go on for ever. I've told the dad, and I'll tell
    you, that
    <i>I will not have</i>

    my political career ruined by any baronetcy. And if you
    insist&#8212;may I respectfully inform you what I shall do? May
    I respectfully inform you&#8212;may I?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. John!</p>

    <p>JOHN. I shall chuck Siege and go into the Flying Corps. And
    that's flat. If you really want to shorten my life, all you
    have to do is to stick to that bally baronetcy.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Your father won't allow you to join the Flying
    Corps.</p>

    <p>JOHN. My father can't stop me. I know the mess is expensive,
    but the pay's good, and I've got &#163;150 of my own. Not a
    fortune! Not a fortune! But enough, quite enough.
    <i>A short life and a merry one</i>

    One of our old boys. He's delighted. He gave me Lanchester's
    'Aircraft in Warfare' to read. Here it is. (

    <p>MRS. CULVER. You don't mean it!</p>

    <p>JOHN. I absolutely do.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>after a pause</i>

    ). John, you're trying to bully your mother.</p>

    <p>JOHN. Not in the least, mater. I'm merely telling you what
    will happen if father accepts that piffling baronetcy.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>checking a tear; very sweetly</i>

    ). Well, my pets, you make life just a little difficult for me.
    I live only for you and your father. I think first of your
    father, and then of you two. For myself, I am perfectly
    indifferent. I consider all politics extremely silly. There
    never were any in my family, nor in your father's. And to me
    it's most extraordinary that your father should catch them so
    late in life. I always supposed that after thirty people were
    immune. (
    <i>To</i>

    John.) You, I suppose, were bound to have them sooner or later,
    but that
    <i>Hilda</i>

    should go out of her way to contract them&#8212;well, it passes
    me. It passes me. However, I've no more to say. Your father had
    made up his mind to accept the title. You want him to refuse
    it. I hate to influence him

    TRANTO. I called for you at the Ministry.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>leaning forward</i>

    ). That's quite against the rules. The rules are made for the
    moral protection of the women-clerks.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. They told me you'd left early.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Why did you call?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Shall I be frank?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Are you ever?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I wanted to walk home with you.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Are you getting frightened about that next
    article of mine?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. No. I've lost all interest in articles.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Even in my articles?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Even in yours. I'm only interested in the writer of
    your articles. (
    <i>Agitated</i>

    .) Miss Hilda, the hour is about to strike.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. What hour?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Listen, please. Let me explain. The situation is
    this. Instinct has got hold of me. When I woke up this morning
    something inside

    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page105" name="page105">[pg 105]</a>
    </span>

    me said: 'You must call at the Ministry for that young woman
    and walk home with her.' This idea seemed marvellously
    beautiful to me; it seemed one of the most enchanting ideas
    that had ever entered the heart of man. I thought of nothing
    else all the morning. When I reached the Ministry and you'd
    gone, I felt as if I'd been shot. Then I rushed here. If you
    hadn't been at home I don't know what I should have done. My
    fever has been growing every moment. Providentially you
    <i>are</i>

    here. I give you fair warning that I'm utterly in the grip of
    an instinct which is ridiculously unconventional and which will
    brook no delay. I repeat, the hour is about to strike.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>rousing herself</i>

    ). Before it actually strikes, I want to ask a question.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. But that's just what
    <i>I</i>

    want to do.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Please. One moment of your valuable time.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. The whole of my life.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Last night, why did you advise papa to give way
    to mamma and accept the baronetcy?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Did I?</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 102 -->
    <span class="pagenum">

    </span>

    HILDEGARDE. It seems so.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Well&#8212;er&#8212;</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. You know it's quite against his principles, and
    against mine and Johnnie's, not to speak of yours.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. The fact is, you yourself had given me such an
    account of your mother's personality that I felt sure she'd win
    anyhow; and&#8212;and&#8212;for reasons of my own, I wished to
    be on the winning side. No harm in that, surely. And as regards
    principles, I have a theory about principles. Your father was
    much struck by it when I told him.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Namely?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. There are no principles in married life.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Oh, indeed! Well, there may not be any
    principles in your married life, but there most positively will
    be in mine, if I ever have a married life. And let me tell you
    that you aren't on the winning side after all&#8212;you're on
    the losing side.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. How? Has your&#8212;</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Johnnie and I have had a great interview with
    mamma, and she's yielded. She's
<!-- Page 103 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page107" name="page107">[pg 107]</a>
    </span>

    abandoned the baronetcy. In half an hour from now the baronetcy
    will have been definitely and finally refused.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Great Scott!</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. You're startled?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. No! After all, I might have foreseen that you'd come
    out on top. The day before yesterday your modesty was making
    you say that your mother could eat you. I, on the contrary,
    insisted that you could eat your mother. Who was right? I ask:
    who was right? When it really comes to the point&#8212;well,
    you have a serious talk with your mother, and she gives in!</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>gloomily</i>

    ). No!
    <i>I</i>

    didn't do it. I tried, and failed. Then Johnnie tried, and did
    it without the slightest trouble. A schoolboy! That's why I'm
    so upset.</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>shaking his head</i>

    ). You musn't tell me that, Miss Hilda. Of course it was you
    that did it.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>impatiently; standing up</i>

    ). But I
    <i>do</i>

    tell you.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Sorry! Sorry! Do be merciful! My feelings about you
    at this very moment are so, if I may use the term,
    unbridled&#8212;</p>

    HILDEGARDE (
    <i>with false gentle calm</i>

    ). And that's not all. I suppose you haven't by any chance told
    father that I'm Sampson Straight?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Certainly not.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. You're sure?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Absolutely.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Well, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Why?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>quietly sarcastic</i>

    ). Because papa told me you did tell him. Therefore father is a
    liar. I don't like being the daughter of a liar. I hate
    liars.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Aren't you rather cutting yourself off from
    mankind?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>going straight on</i>

    ). For the last day or two father had been giving me such queer
    little digs every now and then that I began to suspect he knew
    who Sampson Straight was. So I asked him right out this
    morning&#8212;he was in bed&#8212;and he had to acknowledge he
    did know and that you told him.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Well, I didn't exactly tell him. He sort of guessed,
    and I&#8212;</p>

    HILDEGARDE (
    <i>calmly, relentlessly</i>

    ). You told him.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. No. I merely admitted it. You think I ought to have
    denied it?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Of course you ought to have denied it.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. But it was true.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. And if it was?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. If it was true, how could I deny it? You've just
    said you hate liars.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>losing self-control</i>

    ). Please don't be absurd.</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>a little nettled</i>

    ). I apologise.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. What for?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. For having put you in the wrong. It's such shocking
    bad diplomacy for any man to put any woman in the wrong.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>angrily</i>

    ). Man&#8212;woman! Man&#8212;woman! There you are! It's always
    the same with you males. Sex! Sex! Sex!</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>quite conquering his annoyance; persuasively</i>

    ). But I'm fatally in love with you.

    <span class="pagenum">

    HILDEGARDE. Well, of course there you have the advantage of
    me.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Don't you care a little&#8212;</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>letting herself go</i>

    ). Why should I care? What have I done to make you imagine I
    care? It's quite true that I've saved your newspaper from an
    early grave. It was suffering from rickets, spinal curvature,
    and softening of the brain; and I've performed a miraculous
    cure on it with my articles. I'm Sampson Straight. But that's
    not enough for you. You can't keep sentiment out of business.
    No man ever could. You'd like Sampson Straight to wear blouses
    and bracelets for you, and loll on sofas for you, and generally
    offer you the glad eye. It's an insult. And then on the top of
    all, you go and give the whole show away to papa, in spite of
    our understanding; and if papa hadn't been the greatest dear in
    the world you might have got me into the most serious
    difficulties.</p>

    <p>TRANTO (

    celebrated man in London. I doubt if there's a fellow I admire
    more in the whole world&#8212;or you either. He's knocked the

    <p>CULVER (

    <p>STRAIGHT. I ought to apologise for coming in like this. But

    <p>MRS. CULVER. You've been so charming about my boy, Mr.

    STRAIGHT. I was so very greatly impressed by your son this
    morning at the Club that I couldn't resist the opportunity he
    gave me of visiting his home. What I say is: like parents, like
    child. I'm an old-fashioned man.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. No one would guess that from your articles in
    <i>The Echo</i>

    . Of course they're frightfully clever, but you know I don't
    quite agree with all your opinions.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. Neither do I. You see&#8212;there's always a
    difference between what one thinks and what one has to
    write.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. I'm so glad. (Culver
    <i>starts and looks round</i>

    <p>CULVER. Nothing! I thought I heard the ice cracking.

    <p>STRAIGHT (

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Arthur!</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. It was still thawing when I came in. As I was
    saying, I'm an old-fashioned man. And I'm a
    provincial&#8212;and proud of it.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. But my dear Mr. Straight, really, if you'll
    excuse me, you look as if you never left the pavement of
    Piccadilly.

    CULVER. Say the windows of the Turf club, darling.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT (

    feel the need of contact with the great world I run over for
    the afternoon to&#8212;St. Ives.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. How remarkable! Then that explains how it is
    you're so deliciously unspoilt.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. Do you mean my face?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. I meant you don't seem at all to realise that
    you're a very great celebrity in London; very great indeed. A
    lion of the first order.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT (
    <i>simply</i>

    ). Lion?</p>

    <p>CULVER. You're expected to roar, Mr. Straight.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. Roar?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. It may interest you to know that my little
    daughter also writes articles in
    <i>The Echo</i>

    . Yes, about war cookery. But of course you wouldn't notice
    them. (Hildegarde
    <i>moves away</i>

    <i>apologetically</i>

    ) your mere presence is making her just a wee bit nervous.

    HILDEGARDE (
    <i>from a distance, striving to control herself</i>

    ). Oh, Mr. Sampson Straight. There's one question I've been
    longing to ask you. I always ask it of literary lions&#8212;and
    tigers.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. Tigers?</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Do you write best in the morning or do you burn
    the midnight oil?</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. Oil?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Do sit down, Mr. Straight. (
    <i>She goes imploringly to</i>

    Hildegarde,
    <i>who has lost control of herself and is getting a little
    hysterical with mirth. Aside to</i>

    Hildegarde.)</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>sitting down by</i>

    Straight.) And so, although you prefer a country life, the lure
    of London has been too strong for you in the end.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. I came to town on business.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Ah!</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. The fact is, business of the utmost importance.
    Perhaps I may be able to interest you in it.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Now we're getting hotter.</p>

    STRAIGHT. Hotter?</p>

    <p>CULVER. Go on, go on, Mr. Straight.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. To tell you the truth&#8212;</p>

    <p>CULVER. Always a wise thing to do.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. One of my reasons for accepting your son's kind
    invitation was that I thought that conceivably you might be
    willing to help in a great patriotic scheme of mine. Naturally
    you show surprise.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Do I? Then I'm expressing myself badly. I'm not in
    the least surprised. It is the contrary that would have
    surprised me.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. We may possibly discuss it later.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Later? Why later? Why not at once? I'm full of
    curiosity. I hate to let the grass grow under my feet.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT (
    <i>looking at the floor</i>

    ). Grass? (
    <i>With a faint mechanical laugh</i>

    .) Ah yes, I see. Figure of speech. Well, I'm starting a little
    limited liability syndicate.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Precisely what I thought. Yes?</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. The End-the-war Syndicate.</p>

    JOHN (
    <i>approaching</i>

    ). But surely you aren't one of those pacifists, Mr. Straight!
    You've always preached fighting it out to a finish.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. The object of my syndicate is certainly to fight
    to a finish, but to finish in about a week&#8212;by means of my
    little syndicate.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Splendid! But there is one draw-back. New capital
    issues are forbidden under the Defence of the Realm Act.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. Even when the object is to win the war?</p>

    <p>CULVER. My dear sir, the Treasury would never permit such a
    thing.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. Well, we needn't have a limited company. Perhaps
    after all it would be better to keep it quite private.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Oh! It would. And what is the central idea of this
    charming syndicate?</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. The idea is&#8212;(
    <i>looking round cautiously</i>

    )&#8212;a new explosive.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Again, precisely what I thought. Your own
    invention?</p>

    <p>

    STRAIGHT. No. A friend of mine. It truly is the most marvellous
    explosive.</p>

    <p>CULVER. I suppose it bangs everything.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT (
    <i>simply</i>

    ). Oh, it does. A development of trinitrotoluol on new lines. I
    needn't say that my interest in the affair is purely
    patriotic.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Of course. Of course.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. I can easily get all the capital I need.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Of course. Of course.</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. But I'm not in close touch with the official
    world, and in a matter of this kind official influence is
    absolutely essential to success. Now you
    <i>are</i>

    in touch with the official world. I shouldn't ask you to
    subscribe, though if you cared to do so there would be no
    objection. And I may say that the syndicate can't help making a
    tremendous lot of money. When I tell you that the new explosive
    is forty-seven times as powerful as trinitrotoluol
    itself&#8212;</p>

    <p>CULVER. When you tell me that, Mr. Straight, I can only
    murmur the hope that you haven't got any of it in your
    pocket.</p>

    STRAIGHT (
    <i>simply</i>

    ). Oh, no! Please don't be alarmed. But you see the immense
    possibilities. You see how this explosive would end the war
    practically at once. And you'll understand, of course, that
    although my articles in
    <i>The Echo</i>

    have apparently caused considerable commotion in London, and
    given me a position which I am glad to be able to use for the
    service of the Empire, my interest in mere journalism as such
    has almost ceased since my friend asked me to be secretary and
    treasurer of the syndicate.</p>

    <p>CULVER. And so you're the secretary
    <i>and</i>

    treasurer?</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. Yes. We don't want to have subscribers of less
    than &#163;100 each. If you cared to look into the
    matter&#8212;I know you're very busy, but a mere
    glance&#8212;</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. Just so.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Impossible!</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. Pardon me. One moment. I was told there was a
    danger of my being inconvenienced in London by one of these
    military raids for rounding up slackers, and as I happen to
    have a rather youthful appearance, I took the precaution of
    bringing with me my birth-certificate and registration card. (

    CULVER. Do you really think so?</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT. The explanation is simplicity itself. (
    <i>A sudden impulse</i>

    .) Nothing but that. Put yourselves in my place. I come to
    London. I hear a vast deal of chatter about some articles in a
    paper called
    <i>The Echo</i>

    by some one calling himself 'Sampson Straight.' I also hear
    that nobody in London knows who Sampson Straight is. As I
    happen to
    <i>be</i>

    Sampson Straight, and as I have need of all possible personal
    prestige for the success of my purely patriotic mission, it
    occurs to me&#8212;in a flash!&#8212;to assert that I am the
    author of the famous articles.... Well, what more natural?</p>

    <p>CULVER. What indeed?</p>

    <p>STRAIGHT (
    <i>to</i>

    Tranto). And may I say that I'm the only genuine Sampson
    Straight in the United Kingdom, and that in my opinion it was a
    gross impertinence on the part of your contributor to steal my
    name? Why did you let him do it?</p>

    <p>TRANTO (
    <i>beginning reflectively</i>

    ). Now
    <i>I</i>

    hit on that name&#8212;not my contributor. It was when I was
    down in Cornwall. I caught sight of it in an old yellow
    newspaper in an old yellow hotel, and it struck me at once what
    a fine signature it would make at the bottom of a slashing
    article. By the way, have you ever been in the dock?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. But I'm very proud, my pet. Of course I think
    you might have let me into the secret&#8212;</p>

    CULVER. None of us were let into the secret, Hermione&#8212;I
    mean until comparatively recent times. It was a matter between
    Hilda's conscience and her editor.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Oh! I'm not complaining. I'm so relieved she
    didn't write those dreadful cookery articles.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. But do you mean to say you aren't frightfully
    shocked by my advanced politics, mamma?</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. My child, how na&#239;ve you are, after all! A
    woman is never shocked, though of course at times it may suit
    her to pretend to be. Only men are capable of being shocked. As
    for your advanced politics, as you call them, can't you see
    that it doesn't matter what you write so long as you are
    admired by the best people. It isn't views that are
    disreputable, it's the persons that hold them.</p>

    <p>CULVER. I hope that's why you so gracefully gave way over
    the baronetcy, my dear.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER (
    <i>continuing to</i>

    Hildegarde). There's just one thing I should venture to
    suggest, and that is, that you cease at once to be a typist and
    employ one yourself instead. It's most essential
<!-- Page 126 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page130" name="page130">[pg 130]</a>
    </span>

    that you should live up to your position. Oh! I'm very proud of
    you.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. I don't quite know what my position is.
    According to the latest news I'm dead. (
    <i>Challengingly to</i>

    Tranto.) Mr. Tranto, you're keeping rather quiet, nearly as
    quiet as John (John
    <i>changes his seat</i>

    ), but don't you think you owe me some explanation? Not more
    than a quarter of an hour ago in this very room it was
    distinctly agreed between us that you would not kill Sampson
    Straight, and now you rush back in a sort of homicidal
    mania.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Oh! I'd no idea Mr. Tranto had called already
    this morning!</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. Yes. I told him all about everything, and we
    came to a definite understanding.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Oh!</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I'm only too anxious to explain. I killed Sampson
    for the most urgent of all possible reasons. The Government is
    thinking of giving him a baronetcy?</p>

    <p>CULVER. Not
    <i>my</i>

    baronetcy?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Precisely.</p>

    <p>

    </span>

    MRS. CULVER. But this is the most terrible thing I ever heard
    of.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. It is. I met one of my chaps in the street. He was
    coming here to see me. (
    <i>To</i>

    Culver.) Your answer was expected this morning. It didn't
    arrive. Evidently your notions about titles had got abroad, and
    the Government has decided to offer a title to Sampson Straight
    this afternoon if you refuse.</p>

    <p>CULVER. But how delightfully stupid of the Government.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. On the contrary it was a really brilliant idea.
    Sampson Straight is a great literary celebrity, and he'd look
    mighty well in the Honours List. Literature's always a good
    card to play for Honours. It makes people think that Cabinet
    Ministers are educated.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE. But I've spent half my time in attacking the
    Government!</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Do you suppose the Government doesn't know that? In
    creating you a baronet (
    <i>gazes at her</i>

    ) it would gain two advantages&#8212;it would prove how
    broad-minded it is, and it would turn an enemy into a
    friend.</p>

    <p>
<!-- Page 128 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page132" name="page132">[pg 132]</a>
    </span>

    HILDEGARDE. But surely the silly Government would make some
    enquiries first!</p>

    <p>CULVER. Hilda, do remember what your mother said, and try to
    live up to your position. This isn't the Government that makes
    enquiries. It's the Government that gets things done.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. You perceive the extreme urgency of the crisis. I
    had to act instantly. I did act. I slew the fellow on the spot,
    and his obituary will be in my late extra. The danger was
    awful&#8212;greater even than I realised at the moment, because
    I didn't know till I got back here that there was a genuine and
    highly unscrupulous Sampson Straight floating about.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Danger? What danger?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Danger of the Government falling, dear lady. You
    see, it's like this. Assuming that the Government offers a
    baronetcy to Sampson Straight, and the offer becomes public
    property, as it infallibly would, then there are three
    alternatives. Either the Government has singled out for honour
    a person who doesn't exist at all; or it has sought to turn a
    woman (
    <i>glancing at</i>

    Hilda) into a male creature; or it is holding up to public
    admiration an ex-convict. Choose which
<!-- Page 129 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page133" name="page133">[pg 133]</a>
    </span>

    theory you like. In any case the exposure would mean the
    immediate ruin of any Government.</p>

    <p>HILDEGARDE (
    <i>to</i>

    Tranto). I always thought you
    <i>wanted</i>

    the Government to fall.</p>

    <p>CULVER. Good heavens, my gifted child! No enlightened and
    patriotic person wants the Government to fall. All enlightened
    and patriotic persons want the Government to be afraid of
    falling. There you have the whole of war politics in a
    nut-shell. If the British Government fell the effect on the
    Allied cause would be bad, and might be extremely bad. But
    that's not the real explanation. The real explanation is that
    no one wants the Government to fall because no one wants to
    step into the Government's shoes. However, thanks to Tranto's
    masterly presence of mind in afflicting Sampson with a disease
    that kills like prussic acid, the Government can no longer give
    Sampson a title, and the danger to the Government is therefore
    over.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. Over! I wish it was! Supposing the Government
    doesn't happen to see my late extra in time! Supposing the
    offer of a baronetcy to Sampson Straight goes forth! The
    mischief will be done. Worst of all, supposing the only genuine
    Sampson Straight hears of it and accepts
<!-- Page 130 -->
    <span class="pagenum">
      <a id="page134" name="page134">[pg 134]</a>
    </span>

    it! A baronetcy given to a bigamist! No Government could
    possibly survive the exposure.</p>

    <p>MRS. CULVER. Not even if its survival was necessary to the
    success of the Allied cause?</p>

    <p>CULVER (
    <i>gloomily, shaking his head</i>

    ). My dear, Tranto is right. This great country has always
    insisted first of all, and before anything else whatever, on
    the unsullied purity of the domestic life of its public men.
    Let a baronetcy be given, or even offered, to a
    bigamist&#8212;and this great country would not hesitate for
    one second, not one second.</p>

    <p>TRANTO. The danger still exists. And only one man in this
    world can avert it.</p>

    <p>CULVER. You don't mean me, Tranto?</p>

    <p>TRANTO. I understand that you have neither accepted nor
    refused the offer. You must accept it instantly. Instantly.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
